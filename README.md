## Preamble

When we talk about career planning, this question seems too complicated. How do you plan when the world outside your window is changing every day? How to plan a career? You'll learn how to plan even as the world changes. How do you move toward your goal? What do you do to see opportunities within the company? At what point do you tell your supervisor that you want to grow?

Key competencies for career growth: What competencies are needed for career advancement? You understand what distinguishes the thinking of a person who sees possibilities or sees limitations, and how to restructure thinking. You'll find out how to develop the most important competencies: ability to see opportunities and self-presentation.

## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III

## How to plan a career

How do you plan when the world outside is changing every day? What if you plan something and can't implement it? Or you invest time in development and still don't reach your goals. Do we need to plan at all?

Definitely, yes. Having a goal that you are striving for changes a lot in your life:

- You won't just be working, but you'll notice progress, your personal growth and how you're going towards your goal;
- You'll find it easier to make decisions in your daily life. For example, if you have to choose which task to dive more densely into, understanding where you're going will help you make decisions in your daily life;
- Those who have a purpose are less likely to burn out. Watch a video by Viktor Frankl, the founder of logotherapy, a very famous branch of existential psychology. The essence of his main idea is that having meaning influences you to be willing to work harder and to accept situations more easily when things go wrong. Less burnout, higher performance, easier attitude to difficulties.
- When you have a goal, you're more motivated and less likely to procrastinate. If you've gotten lazy and you notice that you lack energy and motivation, make sure you have a goal.

Remember, you planned your 5-year career goal in Project 00, which was based on your desires and plans. After you've worked for a while, your career goal may change and you'll have more conditions to analyze. You need to learn a more expanded "Career Goal" chart that you can come back to throughout your career.

![Expanded career goal](misc/images/CT07.01.png)

1. Start by defining point A, the point of here and now. Think about your current career status. Honestly describe your situation right now. Even if you're not happy about something yet, write it as it is.
2. Point B is your goal one year from now. Think about it: what do you want to accomplish at this point?
3. Point C - goal in 5 years (strategic goal). What position you can grow to. What directions are available to you at this moment. Keep in mind that most people tend to overestimate their opportunities on a short-term horizon like a week to two and underestimate them in the long run, like a year/five/ten years. There is one more limitation to keep in mind. More often than not, people are more afraid of their strengths than their weaknesses, so it's okay to be scared to dream big.
4. How do you move towards a goal? Development tools are anything through which you gain new knowledge, develop skills, or change behavior/thinking. This can be training, online and offline courses, internship programs, mentoring or coaching.

- Check with your manager or HR representative to find out what resources and opportunities are available for growth, development and training at your company
- You can find out from HR whether the company offers to pay for external training for the employee and on what terms.
- Find out if the company has a mentoring and coaching program, if there are external and/or internal coaches.
- Find out if there are other opportunities to help you reach your goals.
- Find out what development tools the company has, choose the ones that will help you best achieve your goal (points B and C).

## When to talk to your supervisor about the fact that growth is important to you

Every company has its own rules for growth and development. You can ask HR about these rules, opportunities and restrictions.

When do you need to talk to your supervisor about the fact that growth is important to you? The answer is simple: the sooner the better. If you just walk into an internship, meet the supervisor and immediately talk about your plan to grow, you can bring up right away what you need to do to grow, what to look out for, what is the most important outcome for your supervisor. You can do an internship for the sake of doing it, or you can set a goal to grow and get access to the most interesting tasks - it's not hard to figure out which approach is more effective. Consequently, the manager will have a completely different attitude towards you.

## Key competencies for career growth

When it comes to career development, there are two key competencies that help you grow, in addition to perform well and delivering results. These are the two competencies of seeing opportunities and effectively presenting yourself (self-presentation).

**Competence 1: to see the opportunities**

What is the difference between the mindset of a person who grows, develops, gets a new position, and the mindset of a person who doesn't grow? We all live under certain constraints, we most often lack time, money, people, knowledge, experience. Let's look at a few examples.

_Example #1_ The manager is unable to give you a new position. No vacancy, no budget, etc. At this moment you can bump into this limitation and do nothing. You can complain about the imperfections of the company's processes or start looking at the situation from another angle.

For example, you look at where you are going (to point C), and you look at what skills and competencies you need. You are starting to develop and see opportunities for growth, while promotion to a new position is currently impossible for you. You learn what else to study, who to go to for mentoring or guidance, what skills to develop at work, and who else to meet. The skill of seeing opportunities lies in understanding which cross-functional area to master.

You don't need to focus on limitations; you have to focus on what remains possible for you in a given situation.

_Example #2_ I can't plan my career because I don't know if I can and will be able to get a new position next year, and that's why I'm not going to do anything. Why would I try if the result is not guaranteed?

Or

I don't know if I can get a position next year, but I can definitely set a goal with my supervisor again and identify the key competencies I need to develop. And even if I don't get a position, I will become more professional, more confident, and more opportunities will become available to me.

That is the mindset of opportunity.

**Competence 2: the presentation of your results**

The ability to notice and talk about daily results. If no one but you know how well you're doing, what your results are, and that you're growing and doing more challenging tasks, what you have to overcome and how you're doing, no one will guess it. You can talk about your results at team meetings or in regular meetings with your manager.

The time when simply doing a good job was enough for career advancement is irrevocably gone. If you want to grow, it's important to be able to see the result of your work and be able to talk about it.
